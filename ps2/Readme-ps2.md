## Description
Explain what the project does.
==>The main aim of the project is to develop a pentaflake which involves a recursive function to construct a similar patterns of pentagons.
### Features
Describe what your major decisions were and why you did things that way.
==>The major features that i have included in this are "recursive function" which generates a series of similar pattern pentagons,I have implemented background color as "cyan",and i have given mixed RGB colors in a proper manner so that they are adjusted in an equal manner between 0 and 255 for this i have used sfml libraries so that implementation became easy.
### Issues
What did you have trouble with?  What did you learn?  What doesn't work?  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.
==>I have faced trouble in math calculations because i didn't grip on it from past 6 months,I have learned to use recursive algorithm to generate similar figures using sfml at the same time,I am getting the proper pentaflake for my given input, 
### Extra Credit
Anything special you did.  This is required to earn bonus points.
==>For this i have included "RGB" colors in an equal manner to get a proper visual,which is also said by the proffesor in the class,to include all colors in an equal manner.And i have also included the rotation feature where the total pentaflake rotates clock wise and i have set the speed to 100.5f. 
## Pair Programming
How did working with a partner affect
==>I have not worked with any partner.
## Acknowledgements
List all sources of help including the instructor or TAs, classmates, and web pages.
==>I have used the ps2 pdf for math calculations and also to know how to add colors like do i need to add in an equal manner or my wish https://learn-us-east-1-prod-fleet02-xythos.content.blackboardcdn.com/5f9c84db7d38a/29227380?X-Blackboard-S3-Bucket=learn-us-east-1-prod-fleet01-xythos&X-Blackboard-Expiration=1728172800000&X-Blackboard-Signature=QqLCT8gCXJ1SJWXByr75tA4mMvw8IlxJjWVxEZfvjT0%3D&X-Blackboard-Client-Id=301799&X-Blackboard-S3-Region=us-east-1&response-cache-control=private%2C%20max-age%3D21600&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27ps2-pentaflake.pdf&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEKz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJIMEYCIQCptxlyU1XjZX49z%2FO2EIPaPoGy4cl4HHNezUsk9XEP1AIhAKu7Ttx%2FCsjZK%2FclUnNh9c0BzuyMR7rHQFeR6pbzAr%2BIKr0FCPX%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQBBoMNjM1NTY3OTI0MTgzIgx0Qi0xasflh4NNynIqkQVSqE0BJdm3KJ7WhRMkZKjJx8Jt3APG3A7c9TFEWl7EiS8WNfigU5RYCIGsQeb5N7RJcT0Pd7KdvJyXbvUTwIRrH2WQrogrm%2B%2FNpMo9s0GrEef2QBcw0V9zpQWYUThE8hdsBydvhPq1AkaVTwlh1HxOxs8lHu0Y2bsK5aG473bRTNjFpCDH8r1vpmb%2BcZinZQvoTPEZA%2BYSh7fNQL%2Fy7zj%2BoOID%2FkvzogB2g%2FjL3Puabar%2B3J6o3VVmP9sTdYVLNnDofifi4kVWgUGMesw%2BRR2ZS4aWJpnJiEzAzknmrYmRPpFjWNvX8XFBwgTJzHm4scvWgqzYrwJzsQLmUR4faR385wzaUqErhuArGg%2ByGFnc4Oiy95CRgo5Q9OPU99AtUF%2BEGu00YxvT12UkPYm3NLp8gaBFUWCcmSxKWrToyL3eb8fU31qlDvjhhCXhHkP30TJv%2BLYYU6am%2Bra3sFYTdL4oVnmzc9J92ctgYVLdaJvIWdGB%2BMz4hD5mwv%2BcA0brrgOuesLL304LqW3U0oUFfuNfjUbOxaVwF0C%2BdVbFNajXCo%2F0yx%2B6D1SYH40CII%2FPb6sMDrxsXnXetc5rfRmuhiIpq3dmFx24sc79KkTe5CY0ckk4ZVDL5GUo1fiYRGb5%2F%2FUBQktl4La%2FT3dyYFh3Z%2B1NXlgqzZH74wvMjamX6wRVkzYuAuH5uA0OmSZTzX5ja%2F5giV40ZEvhs2eXpQMCZre1HbsHCfdf4UYB1AW4F2nxTOdiHTOITYPg9NL9aBrEB%2Bfiu9sd9%2FfakCBhRM7%2FAeP%2FAXhJkbv6qlQuZQftx3ssYTZW%2ByLSE6B%2FgI8ZfJszJJtdSiAk7RjURwvrFlvX5PQz9kW6Q75sfwgAsfF17fJSPLswqqiGuAY6sAEKpp1Tej0S%2FusYPsBllgTvltxDmiHpq9CsDwrZLLvBqWDlOU4dAaAAsaT6yyz2QeBRzS7pJuGAlQKf3iGU9aMoRA5BW%2ByTUSMjWJ3CUCykgWWiGJreWaikT2qOcU7k0GMlwIE59bv%2BCo4stIJjE9ibQuv8McaZLaZuSO1ikcPU4IWFiaE6UcvkRk7gIuxjHHuRWLxQHjg5tfpr9OFmg2gmtAeAAKB1o9vmDA3Sbvum1Q%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20241005T180000Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=21600&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZH6WM4PLVHHMGGNB%2F20241005%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=652615c5e45d36b6ad3a90a94e15894ed4f74f547a33d0ad5bce8012a4083557. 
And i have also watched the following youtube video to understand the recursive algorithm implementation https://youtu.be/8S_r_-Ychos?si=t42hHkkHhTwDjbFi.
