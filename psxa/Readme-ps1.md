# PS1: LFSR / PhotoMagic

## Contact
Name:Ashish Kosana

Section:202

Time to Complete:7 hours


## Description
Explain what the project does.
==>The main aim of the project is to encrypt and decrypt a digital image,using  linear feedback shift register to generate the pseudo random bits.

### Features
Describe the representation you used and why you did things that way as well as any other interesting design decisions you made.
==>The features i have implemented are as follows:
#### Part a

#### Part b
==>I have used xor operation to xor each pixel with the number generated by LFSR.
==>I have used sfml for both image loading and handling.
==>I have used both windows for displaying original and transformed images.
### Issues
What doesn't work.  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.
==>Everything is working properly which i have implemented in the code.

### Tests
Describe what is being tested in your Boost unit tests.
==>In my unit test cases i have implemented the following:
==>teststepFunction:to verify the step in my FibLFSR class.
==>testGenerateFunction:to test the generate function.
==>testInitialization:to test the initilization of fiblfsr.
==>testemptyseed:to test fiblfsr rejects empty seeds.
==>testinvalidseedcharacters:to test only 0 and 1 are in binary seed.
==>testvalidateseed:to test the seed wether it is valid or not.
==>testimagetransform:to test encryption and decryption.
### Extra Credit
Anything special you did. This is required to earn bonus points.
==>I have added the alphanumeric feature for encryption and decryption.
