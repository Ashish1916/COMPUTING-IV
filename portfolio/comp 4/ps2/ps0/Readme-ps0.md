## Description
Explain what the project is supposed to do.
==>The main aim of the project is to develop a code with movable sprite(2D image) by responding for the specific keystrokes(keyboard presses).

### Features
Describe what your major decisions were and why you did things that way.
==>The major features that i have added to this code is adjusted the image size to (0.5f,.5f),i have given the background color as White,adjusted the window size as(1000,800)pixels,and i have adjusted the movement speed to 200.0f,also added a (100,120) size rectangle shape.I have adjusted the rectangle position to (50.0f,55.0f).I have given keystrokes as "A" to move the sprite to left,"D" to move right,"W" to move up,"S" to move down.
### Issues
What doesn't work.  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.
==>when i frequently press the keys for long time and stops,and if i press a key immediately after stopping then the sprite taking some time to move rather than the first time.
### Extra Feature
Describe anything special you did.  This is required to earn points.
==>The Extra feature that i am included in this code is changing the background colors while moving the sprite(2D object) with the keys.where the background color will change to four different colors for four different keystrokes irrespective of the main background color(white).

## Integrity
Read the University policy Academic Integrity, and answer the following question:

There are six examples of academic misconduct, labeled (a) through (f). Other than (a), "Seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation," which of these do you think would most apply to this class, and why? Write approx. 100-200 words. Note: there is no single correct answer to this. I am looking for your opinion.
==>I think the 6th one (engages in conduct aimed at making false representation of a studentâ€™s academic performance) apply to this class because,,Claiming achievements or skills that the student does not achieved, such as increasing their role in projects, showing up their contributions, or misshowing their level of knowledge in certain areas is not correct.I also think falsifying the academic performance of a student is not good because he/she required to get the appreciation for their own work done by themselves,the academic performance of a student is based on their acheivements through their work, so every student needs the appreciation for their work.
